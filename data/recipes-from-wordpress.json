Inspired by the aroma of simmering beef with fresh broccoli in glossy sauce, they undertook the challenge of recreating it as a plant-based meal. The narrative describes their experimentation in a travel kitchen, developing a vegan version using plant-based beef alternatives, vegan oyster sauce, and vegetable consommé. The author reflects on finally perfecting the recipe while overlooking Hanoi's streets, describing it as 'a testament to the adventures that await us when we open our hearts and kitchens.'",
