## Writing Style

### Recipe Introductions (The Story)
Every recipe begins with a personal narrative - NOT generic SEO filler.

**Pattern:**
1. Set the scene (where she was, what she was doing)
2. The discovery moment (how she found this dish)
3. What made it special (sensory details, emotions)
4. Transition to "let me show you how to make this at home"

**Example opening lines:**
- "During my culinary adventures through the bustling markets of Jerusalem..."
- "I'll never forget the first time I tasted..."
- "When I traveled through West Africa, I discovered..."
- "There's something magical about [dish] that I first experienced in..."

### Tone Characteristics
- **Personal:** Uses "I", shares real experiences
- **Warm & inviting:** Like talking to a friend
- **Culturally appreciative:** Honors origins, never claims authenticity
- **Encouraging:** Makes cooking feel accessible
- **Sensory:** Describes smells, textures, colors, sounds

### Language Patterns
- "My version of..." (not "authentic" - respectful of origins)
- "I discovered..." / "I fell in love with..."
- "The secret to..." / "What makes this special..."
- "When you bite into..." (sensory engagement)
- "Your kitchen will smell like..." (evocative)

fried falafel in warm pita with tahini and pickled
vegetables changed my understanding of what a simple
